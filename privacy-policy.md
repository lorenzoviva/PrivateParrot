# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you use the Private Parrot Google Chrome extension (the "Extension").

## Information We Collect

The Extension collects the following information:

- **Chat Information**: When you use the Extension to generate and complete responses in web chats, we collect and store the text of your conversations. This includes messages sent and received through supported web chat providers such as Telegram and Whatsapp. The collected chat information includes the content, timing, and contact name of the message sender. This data is stored locally in your browser using the Chrome Storage API.

- **User Anonymization Data**: In the Extension's interface, you have the option to provide additional information to enforce privacy in group or private chats. This may include contact names and other sensitive information. This data is used solely for the purpose of anonymization and is stored locally on your device.

  - Random Data Types: The Extension offers various categories for anonymizing sensitive information provided by the user, such as contact names. These categories include:

    - Addresses
    - Animal Names
    - Company Names
    - Couple Nicknames
    - Female Names
    - First Names
    - Gaming Nicknames
    - Last Names
    - Male Names
    - Nicknames
    - Phone Numbers
    - License Plates
    - Usernames
    - Passwords

    Whenever the Extension encounters the specified sensitive information in a chat message, it replaces it with a randomly generated value from the corresponding category, ensuring privacy. The data used for anonymization is stored locally in your browser using the Chrome Storage API.

- **API Key**: To access the language models from OpenAI and HuggingFace, you are required to provide an API key. This key is used for authentication and API calls to the language model providers. The API key is stored locally in your browser using the Chrome Storage API.

  All information is stored locally in the browser using the Chrome Storage API, and it is not transmitted to any external servers outside the language model providers. User Anonymization Data is never transmitted.

## Use of Information

We use the collected information for the following purposes:

- **AI-Powered Responses**: The Extension utilizes AI models from OpenAI and HuggingFace to generate and complete responses in web chats. The collected chat information, including the anonymized user data, is used solely for making API calls to the language model providers. The Extension does not train on user data, and the data remains stored locally on your device throughout the runtime of the Extension.

- **Privacy Protection and User Anonymization**: The Extension employs user anonymization techniques to protect privacy. Sensitive information provided by the user, such as contact names, is replaced with randomly generated values from the corresponding category, as mentioned in the "Information We Collect" section. This ensures that the original sensitive information is not exposed during AI processing. The data used for anonymization is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted or stored on any external servers.

Please note that all data collected and used by the Extension is stored locally in your browser using the Chrome Storage API. The Extension does not own or operate any servers to store or process user data.

## Data Storage and Deletion

All data collected by the Extension is stored locally on your device using the Chrome Storage API within your browser. The data is not transmitted to any external servers outside the language model providers. As the data is stored locally, the Extension provides you with options to manage your data:

- **Data Retention**: The Extension does not automatically delete stored data. The chat information and user anonymization data remain stored locally on your device until you choose to delete them using the provided options.

- **Data Deletion**: You have the ability to delete the stored chat information, user anonymization data, and API keys at any time using the Extension's interface. The "Clear storage" button performs a complete reset, deleting all stored data. Additionally, the "Clear cache" button deletes conversations from the cache.

## Children's Privacy

The Private Parrot Extension is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 18 ("minors"). We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided personal information through the Extension, please contact us at private.parrot.extension@gmail.com. We will assist you in identifying and removing any personal information stored on the user's browser through the Google Chrome Storage API. It's important to note that the extension itself does not own or directly handle any system or user information. All information is stored locally on the user's browser and is managed by the extension during runtime.

## Third-Party Services

The Extension relies on third-party services provided by OpenAI and HuggingFace to access language models. When using the Extension, you may be required to obtain an API key from these providers. Please refer to their respective privacy policies and terms of service for information on how they handle your data.

## Updates to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the Extension or applicable regulations. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any updates.
